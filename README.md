# Manage your money

- Final project for universities
- The project was created to get to know GraphQL, API Platform, Angular
- The project contains a strange solution because I was doing various tests. **This project should not be taken as a best practice!**

## TODO:

- [ ] refactoring endpoint for receive all data for model (current is find all and receive redundant data)
- [ ] tests graphql mutations (refactoring from save in api platform endpoint to graphql)
